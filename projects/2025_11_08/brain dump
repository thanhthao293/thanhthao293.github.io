1) eda

* rocket statuses (active/retired)
  - active: operational, available for or currently performing missions
  - retired: permanently taken out of service due to end of program, end of planned lifespan, or high cost
  
* mission statuses (success/failure/partial failure/prelaunch failure)
- partial failure: payload didnt reach the intended orbit or fulfill all of its objectives, but the vehicle didnt completely fail and the payload may still have been functional or recoverable to some degree
- prelaunch failure: an event before liftoff that results in destruction of payload/rocket
- failure: total loss of mission's objectives (payload is lost or damaged during launch or in orbit)

* identify country origin for each company
  - AMBA (Juno 1/Explorer 1) should be ABMA (Army Ballistic Missile Agency)? 
  - CECLES: Frech acronym for the European Launcher Development Organization (ELDO)
  - EER (METEOR): parent company of SSIA, bought SSIA in Dec 1990
  - ILS: American company but a subsidiary of Russian State Space Company Roskosmos
  - Land Launch: service product of Sea Launch
  - Sandia (National Laboratories)
  - SRC (State Rocket Center)
  - UT (University of Tokyo)

-> steps taken:
    - changed AMBA -> ABMA
    - added 'origin' column to reflect the country of origin for each company
    - added 'alternative_origin' column for companies that are owned by multiple countries
