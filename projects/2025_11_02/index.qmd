- case detection rate (cdr): disease cases reported / total number of cases 
  - high rate = effective disease surveillance
  
- case notification rate (cnr): new + relapse + cases with unknown previous TB treatment / 100,000

- case fatality ratio (cfr): number of deaths among the number of diagnosed cases only, regardless of time or total population
  - vs mortality rate: number of deaths (either in general or due to a specific cause) within the entire population per unit of time (wiki)

- incident case: people who develop a disease aka new cases
