I recently earned my bachelor's degree in Data Science & Statistics from Miami University and am gearing up to earn my master's degree in Statistics. My journey so far has taken me from working as a consultant intern at Miami University's Statistical Consulting Center, where I helped tackle complex research projects, to interning as a BI Analyst at Evolv Technology, where I honed my skills in handling real-world data challenges. Along the way, I've learned that (most of the time) data holds the answers we are searching for, and I enjoy bringing them to light using my ever-expanding analytical toolbox.
